## Overview

### Purpose

* about 51% of Vine reviews are 5-stars
* about 39% of non-Vine reviews are 5-stars

## Summary
According to the data, there are far more reviews from people that are not part of the vine program. This makes sense due to the fact that Vine reviews receive the product for free and are meant to provide initial reviews for the items in question. One thing to note though is that there are noticeably a higher percentage of Reviewers that provided a 5-star review from the Vine Reviews compared to the Reviews not from the Vine program. This may be due to multiple reasons
* There are far more unpaid reviews so the accuracy of the quality of the product may be higher
* the Vine users may be more lenient or biased due to receiving the product for free
